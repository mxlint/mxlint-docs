# Quickstart

MxLint is very versatile. Try out with one of the following guides:

- [Mendix Studio Pro Extension](mendix-studio-pro-extension/installation.md)
- [Pipeline Integration](pipeline-integration/setup.md)

The CLI can be used or integrated in many different ways also. Feel free to share with us if your use case is not yet documented.
