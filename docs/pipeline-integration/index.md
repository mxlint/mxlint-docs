# Introduction

While the [Mendix Studio Pro extension](../mendix-studio-pro-extension/index.md) enables you to get immediate feedback on your project quality as a developer, MxLint can also be used as governance tool.

This can be achieved by for instance adding MxLint to your (existing) Continuous Integration pipelines. You can also choose to scan against a more extensive set of rules than locally on developer machines.

The most important benefit of Pipeline integrations is to enable governance on a platform level. This ensures independent teams are following company standards and best practices centrally managed.
