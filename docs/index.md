MxLint (Formerly Mendix-CLI) is a set of tools to help you build high quality Mendix apps. This is inspired by the success of projects like [PyLint](https://www.pylint.org/) and other linting systems which provide a way to enforce code standards, best practices and guidelines in your code.

## Mission

- Become the standard for linting Mendix apps.
- Provide a way to enforce best practices and guidelines in your code.
- Provide a way to share knowledge and experience between developers.

## Ecosystem

Mxlint is a collection of tools and projects to help you build high quality Mendix apps.

- [MxLint CLI](https://github.com/mxlint/mxlint-cli): The main tool of the MxLint ecosystem. It is used to lint your Mendix project. Can be used directly as CLI tool or as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- [MxLint Extension](https://github.com/mxlint/mxlint-extension): An extension for Mendix Studio Pro to help you lint your Mendix project during development.
- [MxLint Rules](https://github.com/mxlint/mxlint-rules): A place to find and share your rules with the community.
- [MxLint Docs](https://github.com/mxlint/mxlint-docs): This documentation you are reading right now. It also extracts documentation from the rules to provide you with a better experience in a single place.

## Philosophy

MxLint is built on the philosophy that the best way to build Mendix apps is to follow the best practices and guidelines that are outlined in the [Mendix Best practices documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/dev-best-practices/) and most importantly based on the community experience. The collective experience of the developers in the Mendix community is distilled into rules that are then enforced with formal rules.

We also believe knowledge should be shared and that by sharing our experiences we can all learn from each other. Therefore we are aiming for this project to be a community driven project where we can all learn from each other. A project owned by the community and for the community. To live up to this goal we decided to make MxLint an open source project and we welcome contributions from the community.
